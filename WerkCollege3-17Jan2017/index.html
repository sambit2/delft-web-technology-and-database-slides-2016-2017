Your old love is still there, however, so you set up a database company, ArtBase, that builds a product for art galleries. The core of this product is a database with a schema that captures all the information that galleries need to maintain.</p>

<code>Galleries keep information about artists, their names
(which are unique), birthplaces, age,and style of art. For
each piece of artwork, the artist, the year it was made,
its unique title, its type of art (e.g., painting, lithograph,
sculpture, photograph), and its price must be stored. Pieces
of artwork are also classified into groups of various kinds,
for example, portraits, still lifes, works by Picasso, or
works of the 19th century; a given piece may belong to more
than one group.

Each group is identified by a name (like those just given)
that describes the group. Finally, galleries keep information
about customers. For each customer, galleries keep that
person’s unique name, address, total amount of dollars spent
in the gallery (very important!), and the artists and groups
of art that the customer tends to like.</code>

<code> It should record each U.S. state (for instance, Texas)
with its name, number of representatives, and region in which
the state is located (northeast, mid-atlantic, midwest, and so
forth). Each representative, in the House is to be described
by his or her name, the district (by district number) that he
or she represents, the year when he or she was first elected,
and the political party to which he or she belongs (for
instance, Republican, Democrat, Independent, Green, Reform,
Other).

The database should track each bill (legislation) with its 
name, the date on which its vote was taken, whether the bill
passed or failed (so the domain is yes and no), and its
sponsors (the representatives who proposed the bill).
The database should track how each representative voted on
each bill (yes, no, abstain, absent).</code>

<code>The company owns a number of buses, of different types
(e.g. double decker, articulated, urban, etc.). Each bus is
used on different routes.

The workforce of the company is composed by drivers, 
controllers (operating on some journeys), ticket sellers 
working in some bus stops), maintenance and administrative
workers, operating from the company's headquarter. 

For each worker it is required to keep track of his/her
demographic information. For each route, the system must
store information about the starting and ending locations,
as well as all the intermediate stops. Buses are stored at
night in a depot (garage).

Each bus is associated to a unique depot. Each drives is 
assigned to a depot, and his/her first and last journey must
be performed on buses associated to the same depot. Other
journeys during the day might be performed on buses associated
to other depots. </code>
